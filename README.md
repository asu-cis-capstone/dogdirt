Elevator Pitch:
So when it’s 1:30 in the morning and that last long island isn’t agreeing with you, you discover that the bar’s restroom toilet has a healthy coating of someone else’s dinner. It’s time to find another restroom; fast. However it’s late and you don’t know what other establishment is open that won’t be in the exact same condition. Luckily you pull out your phone and open the app DogDirt! It tells you that Jimmy John’s is open until 3 and they have a 4.5 star rating for the restroom. That’s the idea behind DogDirt. As author Taro Gomi knows, everyone poops, but some people have to do it in less than desirable locations. DogDirt aims to find locations for people that they can be comfortable in, or at least get to in a hurry. Furthermore, DogDirt will let the user know what amenities are offered by each bathroom, and when they’re finished with business will allow the user to contribute to the community by offering their own feedback on the restroom they just used.
